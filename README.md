# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview

The goal of this application exercise was to add polish to Robin's web app which was already functioning well. She wants to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. In order to do this, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Mar's hemispheres and the titles of those images, store them on Mongo database, use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the existing web app to accomodate the images.
